** Make sure, you execute the code on cycle servers
*** Compile and verify myBinarySearchTree.hpp implementation with below command on command line

>> g++ -std=c++11 myBinarySearchTree.hpp

*** Compile and verify test_main.cpp implementation with below command on command line

>> g++ -std=c++11 test_main.cpp

*** this will create object file as "a.out" in the same folder
*** execute the code with instance files


>>./a.out instance1.txt output1.txt

*** This will create output1.txt in the same folder. Verify the output


Command to be used:
>> g++ -std=c++11 myBinarySearchTree.hpp
>> g++ -std=c++11 test_main.cpp
>>./a.out instance1.txt output1.txt
