** Make sure, you execute the code on cycle servers
*** Compile and verify myLeftistHeap.hpp implementation with below command on command line
*** Make sure you change the file name as instruction
>> g++ -std=c++11 myLeftistHeap.hpp


*** Compile and verify tester program main.cpp implementation with below command on command line
*** You should include the correct header files in the main.cpp
*** this will create executable with "a.out" in the same folder
>> g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp


*** execute the code with instance files
>>./a.out instance1.txt


*** this will print all your results on the standard output, i.e., the screen.
*** If you want to save your output to a file, run the executable using
>>./a.out instance1.txt > output1.txt


*** now you can use other program, shell script, python, perl, etc. to verify your implementation.


Command to be used:
>> g++ -std=c++11 myLeftistHeap.hpp
>> g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
>>./a.out instance1.txt
>>./a.out instance1.txt > output1.txt
